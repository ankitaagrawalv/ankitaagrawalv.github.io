I am a Senior Software Engineer working at the Natural Language Processing group at Samsung Research Institute Bangalore (India). My current work is focussed on building an intelligent mobile assistant that works on day-to-day, non-templatized human coversations. I have recently completed my Bachelor's and Master's (Dual) Degree in Computer Science from IIT Kanpur (July 2015). There I had the opportunity to work under \href{http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/arnabb/}{Dr. Arnab Bhattacharya}, my M.Tech thesis supervisor, from whom I have learned a lot about Databases. My thesis was primarily focussed on designing a solution for Skyline Query operation, to work effectively and efficiently under highly generalized data settings, that included high-dimensionality and uncertainity in databases. I have also built an easy-to-use and highly extensible library (in C++) for using and implementing skyline algorithms, available \href{http://akshay-agrawal.com/kopSkylines/}{here}. I have also worked under \href{http://csis.pace.edu/lixin/}{Dr. Lixin Tao}, a Senior IEEE Member and Chairperson of Seidenberg School of Computer Science (New York), in the domain of knowledge representation graphs, where we studied the tradeoff between the reasoning cost for including extra relationship links between the concepts in an Ontology and the amount of added expresiveness we get beyond the basic hierarchial information. I have also done a development internship at Microsoft previously.
At IIT Kanpur, I have served as a Teaching assistant for 2 courses, namely, Parallel Programming and Introduction to computer Organisation both taught by Dr. Ajai Jain in two successive semesters.

Apart from my regular involvements, I also like to spend time learning about various fields in Computer Graphics and Computer Networks. I really appreciate the ways of rendering a real world on a 2-d screen, which is as close to the nature as possible and yet with the liberty to include all the imaginative effects to make the outcome more appealing. I also like to play guitar and drive in my free time.
